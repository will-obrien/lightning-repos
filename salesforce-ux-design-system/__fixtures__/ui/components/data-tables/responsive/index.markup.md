When a table exceeds the width of its container, one responsive option is to wrap the table in a `.slds-scrollable_x` class so that the user can scroll horizontally. View the example small and medium form factor tabs to see the effect.

When `.slds-max-medium-table_stacked` is applied to the &ldquo;Grid&rdquo; table, we generate faux `<th>` labels using the `data-label` applied to each cell, and stack the cells instead of lining them up horizontally. This works up until the **medium form factor** breakpoint. After the breakpoint is triggered, the table will lay out horizontally as normal.
