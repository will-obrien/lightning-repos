# Maintainers 

## Release checklist

When we do a release we have several tasks we need to remember to do. This is not a complete list, and will grow over time.

[ ] Update our sketch ui files
[ ] Update our codepen
[ ] Remind designers using the starter kit to npm install to get the latest design system
[ ] Tweet the release
