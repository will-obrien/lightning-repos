<div className="doc lead">
  Tabs keeps related content in a single container that is shown and hidden through navigation.
</div>

<Example title="Tabs Base">
  <CodeView style={{height: '200px'}}>
    <BaseTabs />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

The default tab set style encapsulates everything that is underneath it without enclosing it visually. Because tab sets can be nested, pay close attention to the markup. They are constructed to prevent styles from leaking from parent tab sets into child tab sets.

<Blockquote type="a11y" header="Accessibility Roles">
  Tabbed UIs have three parts with specific ARIA role requirements:
  <ul>
    <li>- The tab list, which should have `role="tablist"`</li>
    <li>- The tabs in that list, which should each be an `<a role="tab">` anchor wrapped in a `<li role="presentation">` list item</li>
    <li>- The tab panels, which display each tab’s content and should each have `role="tabpanel"`</li>
  </ul>
</Blockquote>

### Expected Markup
The following markup is crucial for Accessibility
- Selected tab’s anchor has `aria-selected="true"`, all other tabs’ anchors have `aria-selected="false"`
- Selected tab’s anchor has `tabindex="0"`, all other tabs have `tabindex="-1"`
- Each tab’s anchor has an `aria-controls` attribute whose value is the id of the associated `<div role="tabpanel">`
- Each tab panel has an `aria-labelledby` attribute whose value is the id of its associated `<a role="tab">`

### Expected Keyboard Interactions
- Arrow keys, when focus is on a selected tab, cycle selection to the next or previous tab
- Tab key, when focus is before the tab list, moves focus to the selected tab
- Tab key, when focus is on selected tab, moves focus into the selected tab’s associated tab panel or to the next focusable element on the page if that panel has no focusable elements
- Shift+Tab keys, when focus is on first element in a tab panel, moves focus back to the selected tab

#### JavaScript Needs

The active tab has two markup requirements:
- The `.slds-active` class should be placed on the `li` with `.slds-tabs_{variant}__item`.
- The corresponding `.slds-tabs_{variant}__content` container receives `.slds-show`.
- In order to achieve the focus state styling, apply `.slds-has-focus` to the parent `li`.

Inactive `.slds-tabs_{variant}__content` containers receive `.slds-hide`.

When the user clicks a different tab, move the `.slds-active` class and toggle the `.slds-hide`/`.slds-show` classes.

## With Overflow
The overflow tab style is provided as a tab item type that acts as a menu component and appears as a tab item. It could contain those tab items that don't all fit in a horizontal orientation.

<Example title="Tabs Overflowing">
  <CodeView style={{height: '200px'}}>
    <Overflowing />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

<Blockquote type="note" header="Implementation Guidelines">
  Initialize a default tab set and in the last tab item of the set, apply the additional classes `slds-dropdown-trigger` and `.slds-tabs__item_overflow`. Include an `<a>` element to contain the tab item label like the other tab items. After the `<a>` element, the `.slds-dropdown` segment of a search overflow menu component is used. The `slds-dropdown__list` element also then requires a `slds-dropdown_length-X` class, where X is the number of items to show in it.
</Blockquote>

## With Nested Scoped Tabs

If nesting tabs within tabs, the second set should be rendered as Scoped Tabs to help differentiate between tab sets.

<Example title="Tabs with Nested Scoped Tabs">
  <CodeView style={{height: '200px'}}>
    <TabsWithNestedScopedTabs />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

## Subtabs

Subtabs are used to provide an additional level of navigation below the Global Navigation Tab Bar. Use these tabs when users need to work across multiple sub-pages within a single navigation item.

<Example title="Tabs with Subtabs">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <SubTabSet />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### Expected Behavior

- The first tab within the Subtab Bar is always the default content for the parent navigation item. To differentiate this tab from other sub-navigation tabs, this tab cannot be closed.
- When opening a navigation item for the first time, the default sub-navigation tab can be assumed; don’t show the Subtab Bar.
  - When opening the first additional sub-navigation tab, a new tab bar is inserted containing both the default tab and the new sub-navigation tab.
- All sub tabs are closed when the parent navigation item is closed.
- Subtabs can optionally include a tab menu for additional controls.

### With Focus

<Example title="Subtabs on Focus">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <TabWithFocus />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### With Borders

To add borders on either side of the subtab, add the classes `slds-border_right` and `slds-border_left`, as needed, to the `<li>` with class `slds-sub-tabs__item`.

<Example title="Subtabs with Borders">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <TabsWithBorders />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### With Tab Actions

<Example title="Subtabs with Actions">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <TabActionOverflow />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### Status Options
#### Unsaved Tab

Unsaved tabs receive a blue asterisk on the tab.

<Example title="Subtab Unsaved">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <StatusTab itemUnsaved/>
  </CodeView>
</Example>

<Blockquote header="Additional Tag for Accessibility" type="a11y">
  In order to inform screen readers of the unsaved state, an `<abbr>` tag is used to render the asterisk. The `title` attribute and `aria-label` should read <b>"Tab Not Saved"</b>.
</Blockquote>

<CodeBlock toggleCode={false}>
  <abbr className="slds-indicator_unsaved" title="Tab Not Saved" aria-label="Tab Not Saved">*</abbr>
</CodeBlock>


#### Unread Tab

Unread tabs receive a red dot on the tab.

<Example title="Subtab Unread">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <StatusTab hasNotification/>
  </CodeView>
</Example>

<Blockquote header="Additional Span for Accessibility" type="a11y">
  In order to inform screen readers of new activity in a tab, an extra `<span>` is added before the tab's icon. The `title` attribute and `aria-label` should read <b>"New Activity"</b>, and the `role="alert"` is needed to make the screen reader alert the user of the new activity immediately. The nested assistive text `<span>` should read <b>"New Activity in Tab: [Tab Name Here]"</b>.
  <br/><br/>
  The difference in the text for the `title` and `aria-label` attributes ("New Activity") and the inner assistive text span ("New Activity in Tab: [Tab Name]") prevents repetition while maintaining clarity about activity happening in tabs that the user is not currently working in. When working in another tab, the screen reader informs the user of both the new activity *and* the location of the new activity by reading the verbose text. However, when navigating with a keyboard and coming upon the unread symbol, the user only needs to be informed of the new activity since they are already in proximal context of the tab name.
</Blockquote>

<CodeBlock toggleCode={false}>
  <span aria-label="New Activity" className="slds-indicator_unread" role="alert" title="New Activity">
    <span className="slds-assistive-text">New activity in Tab: Chat - Customer</span>
  </span>
</CodeBlock>

#### Unread and Unsaved Tab

Unread and unsaved tabs receive a blue asterisk with a red dot underneath. Be sure to check out the individual sections above for the Accessibility requirements.

<Example title="Subtab unread and unsaved">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <StatusTab itemUnsaved hasNotification/>
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### With Overflow Tab

Overflowing subtabs are contained in a More dropdown.

<Example title="Subtab with Overflow">
  <CodeView style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <OverflowSubtabs />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### Overflow Tab Open

<Example title="Subtabs with Overflow Open">
  <CodeView style={{height: '200px'}}>
    <OverflowSubtabs isOpen />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### Unread Overflow Tab

<Example title="Subtab with Unread Overflow">
  <CodeView style={{height: '200px'}}>
    <OverflowSubtabs isOpen itemUnread/>
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### Unsaved Overflow Tab

<Example title="Subtab with Unsaved Overflow">
  <CodeView style={{height: '200px'}}>
    <OverflowSubtabs isOpen itemUnsaved/>
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### Unread and Unsaved Overflow Tab

<Example title="Subtab with Unread and Unsaved Overflow">
  <CodeView style={{height: '200px'}}>
    <OverflowSubtabs isOpen itemUnread itemUnsaved/>
  </CodeView>
</Example>

## Vertical

To use vertical tabs, check out the [Vertical Tabs](../vertical-tabs) component

<Example title="Tabs as Vertical">
  {VerticalTabs}
</Example>

## As a Card

To style tabs as a card, add the class `slds-tabs_card` to the `<div>` with the class `slds-tabs_default`. See the following example for guidance on styling cards inside the tab panel content.

<Example title="Tabs as a Card">
  <CodeView style={{height: '600px'}}>
    <TabsWithCards />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

## On Mobile

For mobile, tabs become stacked and act as buttons that drill in to see the tab's content.

<Blockquote header="Expected Interaction" type="note">
  When clicking a mobile tab button, the entire view changes and is replaced with the "content" of that tab. In addition, a back button appears on the top left of the screen to go back to the view with the tabs.
</Blockquote>

<Example title="Tabs on Mobile">
  <CodeView style={{width: '300px', height: '200px', maxWidth: '100%'}}>
    <MobileStacked />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

When there are two or more immediately adjacent tab sets on mobile, the styling adjusts to make them appear as if they're part of one master list.

<Example title="Tabs Adjacent on Mobile">
  <CodeView style={{width: '300px', height: '250px', maxWidth: '100%'}}>
    <AdjacentMobileStacked />
  </CodeView>
</Example>
