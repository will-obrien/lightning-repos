<div className="doc lead">
  A dueling-picklist is used to move options between two lists and is often referred to as a multi-select. Sometimes, the list options can then be re-ordered, depending on the use case.
</div>

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Reorder">
  <MultiSelect dataSet={DefaultSnapShot} />
</Example>

This component is essentially 2 ARIA listboxes side by side, so we follow the [ARIA practices guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox) to help implement their interaction in an accessible way. Some additional details, supplementary to the ARIA guide include:

## Notable Attributes
- `aria-multiselectable="true"` should be set on each listbox
- `aria-selected` should be placed on each `role="option"`, and set to `false` by default
- `aria-labelledby` is used to identify the list to the user and should point to the list label
- `aria-describedby` is used to provide operation instructions for the Drag and Drop interaction
- `tabindex` should be set to "0" when an item is selected and "-1" otherwise

## Focus Management
- Initially, nothing should be selected and the first item in each list should have `tabindex="0"`
- When an item is focused, it becomes selected
- When focus leaves the list, the last selected item remains selected and focusable. When focus returns to the list focus is placed on the last selected item.
- When moving items:
  - With the move button: the items are unselected and added to the target list. The focus should remain on the move button.
  - With a keyboard shortcut: focus remains on the item, but in the target list. Since the item is focused, it is also selected.
  - If there are already selected items in the target list, they stay selected and the new items are added below them.

## Expected Keyboard Navigation
- Each list has a single focusable option inside. There is only ever one focusable option per list and it is expected that a user will use their arrow keys, and some modifier keys, to perform all actions.
- Because we support drag and drop re-ordering within a list, we implement the second multi-select keyboard model.
  - `up` and `down` arrows move focus _and_ selection, with `aria-selected="true"`. Any previously selected items are deselected.
  - `shift + up` and `shift + down` move focus and creates addition selections
  - `ctrl + down` or `ctrl + up` moves focus but selection remains where it is
  - `ctrl + space` toggles selection on the focused option, in addition to previous selections
  - `ctrl + a` selects all options in the list
  - `cmd/ctrl + right` and `cmd/ctrl + left` Moves selected items between lists
  - `space` toggles "Drag and Drop" mode. When in "Drag and Drop" mode:
    - `up` and `down` arrows move the selected items _within_ the current list

## Group Label

A Dueling Picklist should have a group label, similar to using a `fieldset` and `legend` on grouped form controls. To achieve this, wrap the Dueling Picklist in an `slds-form-element` and add a `div` with the same class names that are applied to a `legend` element in a fieldset, `slds-form-element__label slds-form-element__legend slds-text-title_caps`.

<Blockquote header="Labeling the group" type="a11y">
  It is important that the `slds-form-element` `<div>` has the `role="group"` attribute applied, along with `aria-labelledby`, whose value is the ID of the visible group label.
</Blockquote>

<Example title="Dueling Picklist With Group Label">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={DefaultSnapShot} />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

## Responsive

To make the dueling picklist responsive or use it within narrow regions, apply the class `slds-dueling-picklist__column_responsive` to the `<div>`s with class `slds-dueling-picklist__column` that contain options (not the columns that only contain buttons). Any items longer than the space available will truncate with ellipses.

<Example title="Dueling Picklist Responsive">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={CountriesSnapshot} noReorder isResponsive />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

<Blockquote header="Adjusting Height" type="note">
  To adjust the height of the listboxes, set the height using an inline style on _both_ of the `<div>`s with class `slds-dueling-picklist__column`. If you are setting it based on a maximum number of items being shown before scrolling, you can set `height = (2.25rem * numItems) + 1rem`.
</Blockquote>

<CodeBlock toggleCode={false}>
  <div className="slds-dueling-list">
    <div className="slds-dueling-list__column">
      <span className="slds-form-element__label" id="label-1">Available Languages</span>
      <div className="slds-dueling-list__options" style={{height: '10rem'}}>
        {...}
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="slds-dueling-list__column">
      {...}
    </div>
    <div className="slds-dueling-list__column">
      <span className="slds-form-element__label" id="label-2">Selected Languages</span>
      <div className="slds-dueling-list__options" style={{height: '10rem'}}>
        {...}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</CodeBlock>

## Edit Mode

If the user needs to select multiple options for a field, like a list of languages supported, then use a dueling picklist without the re-order arrows on the right.

<Blockquote header="Helpful Assistive Text" type="a11y">
  The assistive text content in the `option-drag-label` `<div>` should provide clear instructions on how to drag and drop with a keyboard.
</Blockquote>

<Example title="Dueling Picklist">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={CountriesSnapshot} noReorder />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### Selected Item

<Blockquote header="Aria Selected" type="a11y">
  <code class="doc">aria-selected</code> should be placed on each <code class="doc">role="option"</code>, and set to <code class="doc">true</code> when the item is selected.
</Blockquote>

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Item Selected">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={SelectedCountriesSnapshot} noReorder />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### Multiple Selected Items

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Multiple Items Selected">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={MultipleSelectedCountriesSnapshot} noReorder />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### Dropped Items

<Blockquote type="a11y" header="Aria Live">
  The `drag-live-region` `<div>` with `aria-live="assertive"` should update as items are moved to provide context about the state and location of the items.
</Blockquote>

<CodeBlock toggleCode={false}>
  <div class="slds-dueling-list">
    <div class="slds-assistive-text" id="drag-live-region" aria-live="assertive">
      Arabic and German: Moved to Selected Languages.
    </div>
  </div>
</CodeBlock>

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Items Dropped">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={DroppedCountriesSnapshot} noReorder />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### Locked Items

If items are not able to be removed from the selected list, a lock icon appears next to the item name.

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with a Locked Item">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={LockedSnapShot} noReorder />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### With Reordering

If the order of the selected options matters, include the vertical arrows to the right. This allows the user to reorder the second listbox of options.

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Reoder Active">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={DefaultSnapShot} />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

The following examples show the process of selecting an item, moving it within a list, and dropping it in a final position.

<Blockquote type="a11y" header="Aria Live">
  Pay attention to the `drag-live-region` `<div>` with `aria-live="assertive"`. This should update as items are moved to provide context about the state and location of the items at all times.
</Blockquote>

#### Item Selected

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Reoder Active Item Selected">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={SelectedSnapShot} />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### Item Grabbed

Within a list, users are able to drag and drop an item.

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Reoder Active Item Grabbed">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={GrabbedSnapShot} />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### Item Moved Within a List

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Reoder Active Item Moved within List">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={MovedInSnapShot} />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### Item Dropped in a List

<Example title="Dueling Picklist with Reoder Active Item Dropped">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={DroppedSnapShot} />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

### Disabled

If the user is not able to interact with the dueling picklist, then it should be marked as disabled.

<Blockquote type="a11y" header="Aria Disabled">
  In disabled mode, both list boxes <code class="doc">ul[role=listbox]</code> should receive <code class="doc">aria-disabled="true"</code>, and all directional buttons should receive the <code class="doc">disabled</code> attribute.
</Blockquote>

<Blockquote type="note" header="Utility Class">
  The class <code class="doc">slds-is-disabled</code> should also be applied to the divs with the class <code class="doc">slds-dueling-list_options</code>.
</Blockquote>

<Example title="Dueling Picklist Disabled">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelect dataSet={DisabledSnapShot} disabled />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

## View Mode

When the user is done selecting options, or is in view mode of the field, they are presented with a comma separated list.

<Example title="Dueling Picklist in View Mode">
  <CodeView>
    <MultiSelectViewMode />
  </CodeView>
</Example>
