import ColorToken from '../../../shared/components/ColorToken';

<div className="lead">
  The brand band provides theming capability that adds personality and improves information density and contrast
</div>

This is the most common use case for the brand band. Our default size is `slds-brand-band_medium`. This will give the brand band image a height of 12.5rem or 200px.

<BrandBandExample size="medium" />

The brand band has a gradient fade into the background color of the page. A dark variant of the page background color fades down from the top of the brand band.

## Brand band sizes

The brand band comes with 3 sizes â€” small, medium and large. These will adjust the height of the brand band image.

**Small**

<BrandBandExample size="small" />

**Medium (Default)**

<BrandBandExample size="medium" />

**Large**

<BrandBandExample size="large" />

## Removing the brand band image

If you need to remove the brand band image from the component, you can simply pass in `slds-brand-band_none` to only display the page background color.

<BrandBandExample size="none" />
