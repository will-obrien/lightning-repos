    <fullName>Case_Record_Type__c</fullName>
    <description>This field is used as a reporting field. Since we have case open record types and case close record types we are using &quot;Buckets&#39;&#39; in the reporting to group them together for readability and using this field as a bucketed field since the standard Record Type field is not available to bucket.</description>
