### An Installable Flow Action   ###

This Flow Action makes SendGrid available to your Flows. Salesforce has a solid Email solution built into Flow, but if your application needs to solve complex email scenarios, SendGrid may be the right tool.

This component will appear in the APEX section of the Cloud Flow Designer palette. Drag the component onto the canvas and connect it to your Flow. The required fields are self-explanatory. You can add plaintext and/or html body fields.

This action currently requires the username and password of a SendGrid account. Future plans include support for application tokens and Named Credentials.
