# Rich Text Output Display Control #

### A Flow Component solution  ###

This is an extremely simple port of the [standard formattedRichText control](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref_lightning_formattedRichText.htm) to work as a Flow Screen Component.

Know a little javascript and want to add some improvements? {Pull requests are welcome}(/pulls) If you're thinking of adding much complexity to the user interface, though, you probably should fork the repo, because we want to keep this baseline version easy-to-use.
