# Lightning Flow Screen Components
flow_screen_components contains lightning components (aura classes) that have been optimized to be inserted into Lightning Flow screens. This mainly means that they:
1) implement the "lightning:availableForFlowScreens" interface so they appear in and can be dragged into Screen Nodes that are added to Flows susing the the Salesforce Cloud Flow Designer (and upcoming Lightning Flow Builder)
2) give attention to their design files because only attributes added to the design file show up in Cloud Flow Designer as available for mapping to and from Lightning Flow variables

Flow Screen Components generally have a visual focus, although they don't absolutely have to.

Flow Screen Components are generally available as of Spring '18.
