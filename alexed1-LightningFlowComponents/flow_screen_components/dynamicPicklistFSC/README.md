# Dynamic Picklist #

### A Flow Extension  ###

This component grabs picklist values and creates a Lightning Design System styled picklist populated with those values.

## How It Works ##

This component exposes two input attributes "object" and "field". Simply pass the desired sObject name and picklist field name on that object and the picklist values will populate. The selected value is passed to an output attribute called "value".
