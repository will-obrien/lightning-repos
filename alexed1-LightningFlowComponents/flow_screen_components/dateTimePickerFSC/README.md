# Date Time Picker #

### A Flow Component solution  ###

This is an extremely simple port of the [standard DateTimePicker](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref_ui_inputDateTime.htm) to work as a Flow Screen Component.

## Install this Component Into Your Org ##

[Install this Component](https://sites.google.com/view/flowunofficial/flow-screen-components/datetime-picker).

See the full set of installation options [here](/install.md).

## How It Works ##

This component exposes a single attribute called "selectedTime". It can be used both as an input parameter to set the starting values and as an output parameter to pass out the selected time. 

## Roadmap ##

Most of the functionality of the underlying base component has not yet been exposed to Flow. We welcome assistance expanding the range of utility of Flow Components.

Know a little javascript and want to add some improvements? {Pull requests are welcome}(/pulls) If you're thinking of adding much complexity to the user interface, though, you probably should fork the repo, because we want to keep this baseline version easy-to-use.
