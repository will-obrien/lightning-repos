# Rich Text Edit Control #

### A Flow Component solution  ###

This is an extremely simple port of the [standard inputRichText control](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref_lightning_inputRichText.htm) to work as a Flow Screen Component.

See the full set of installation options [here](/install.md).

## How It Works ##

This component exposes a single attribute called "value". It can be used both as an input parameter to set the starting values and as an output parameter to pass out the selected time. 

You can display the rich text output of these components in Flows, using either the standard Display Text Field or the new [formattedRichText Flow Screen Component](https://github.com/alexed1/LightningFlowComponents/tree/master/flow_screen_components/formattedRichTextFSC)

Note, though, that the standard Flow Display Text field is capable of displaying some of the rich text effects, but not all:
