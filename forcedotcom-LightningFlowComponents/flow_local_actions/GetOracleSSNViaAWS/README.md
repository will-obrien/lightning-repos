* Oracle sample component
* CSP definition:
We are making a request to an external (non-Salesforce) server so we needed to add the server as a CSP Trusted Site. See [Create CSP Trusted Sites to Access Third-Party APIs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/csp_trusted_sites.htm)
